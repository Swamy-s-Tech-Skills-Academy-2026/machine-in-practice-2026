# GenAI Email & Report Drafting System Repository Verification and Content Enhancement

## Context

You are working with **GenAI Email & Report Drafting System**, an N-Tier web application that generates professional emails and reports using Google Gemini Large Language Models. The repository implements a React.js with TypeScript frontend, Flask REST API backend, PostgreSQL database, and Google Gemini API integration.

**Repository Structure:**

- `frontend/` - React.js with TypeScript application
- `backend/` - Flask REST API with routes, services, and models
- `database/` - PostgreSQL schema and migrations
- `docs/` - Project documentation and architecture diagrams
- `.github/` - GitHub workflows and templates
- `.cursor/` - Cursor AI project rules

**Primary Objective:**
Perform a COMPREHENSIVE audit of the repository using GenAI Email & Report Drafting System standards and quality criteria. Verify file contents, run structured checks, and produce actionable reports with suggestions and fixes.
